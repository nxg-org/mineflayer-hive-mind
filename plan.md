# Plan.


### Features:
- modular/optional control distance
- catch dropped control to main hive mind
- have nested functionality


### 9:53pm, Dec 30:
- my current setup does not allow for the modularity I inititally had.
- I will need to rewrite the HiveBehavior entirely again.
- Perhaps I should create a new Behavior class for each bot and then individually manage them all.
- I have the setup to do it, the autonomous functionality works (Check HiveMindNested).
- There is a lot to do, but I think I have a general concept down.
Hopefully all goes well.
